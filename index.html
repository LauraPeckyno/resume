                        were crucial to our efforts to secure vital funding for
                        the development and scaling of programs that improve
                        STEM education and drive educational equity and

                        and community partners across Washington state, I honed
                        my ability to cultivate meaningful relationships,
                        develop impactful campaigns and messaging, and manage

                        Washington STEM initiatives.</p>

                    My role required both a meticulous approach to
                    communications and a commitment to nurturing authentic
